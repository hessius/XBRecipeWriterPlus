 * accumulated rows from three sub-projects and each one that arrived as more JSX
 * made the next harder to place; the rows are components now, so this file says
 * what the screen offers and nothing about how a row is drawn.
 *
 * The one-line editor hints are deliberately not here. Sub-project 4 put that
 * toggle in the editor's overflow sheet, beside the deck it annotates, which is
 * the better home for it — and `app/__tests__/settings.test.tsx` holds that
 * decision in place.
